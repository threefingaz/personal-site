            Refflow: A Tool to Streamline Sales Referrals Within a Large
            Financial Organization
        </h2>

        <p>
            <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The project description is based on
            actual work experience. However, for confidentiality and legal
            reasons, all visuals and specific details included in this

        <h3>Role</h3>
        <p>
            I was responsible for designing both the mobile app and the desktop
            administration tool. I also proposed process improvements to enhance
            efficiency for the main users.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Scope</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Mobile App:</strong> Tailored for salespeople, this app
                facilitates the making of sales referrals.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Desktop Administration Tool:</strong> Used to manage
                incoming referrals, including assignment to appropriate
                personnel, amendments to referrals, and access to analytics.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Team Collaboration</h3>
        <p>
            Development was led by a single developer. We engaged in regular
            catch-ups with business representatives to iteratively refine the
            app based on user feedback following the initial launch.
        </p>

        <h3>Mobile App Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Referral Receipt and Management:</strong> Salespeople
                receive notifications of referrals for financial products they
                handle. They can then contact the referrer for more details.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Client Interaction:</strong> Once prepared, salespeople
                contact the client to discuss the referral.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Referral Closure:</strong> Successful referrals are
                linked in the CRM system to the corresponding deal, ensuring
                referrers receive their rewards.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Referral Tracking:</strong> The app tracks each
                referral's progress from receipt to closure, with stages marked
                as Acknowledged, Referrer Contacted, Client Contacted, and
                Closed.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Process Improvements</h3>
        <p>
            I recommended allowing salespeople to close referrals at any stage
            to enhance flexibility. Referrals are automatically marked as
            acknowledged upon opening to maintain process transparency. This
            adjustment reduces unnecessary friction and accommodates user
            behavior variability.
        </p>

        <h3>Sent Referrals</h3>
        <p>
            Salespeople can monitor the progress of sent referrals and view any
            assigned rewards.
        </p>

        <h3>User Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            Basic personal analytics are available within the userâ€™s profile,
            allowing them to track their referral activities and outcomes.
        </p>

        <h3>Administration Tool</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Referral Management:</strong> Administrators can modify
                any referral, reassign or initially assign people if the
                referrer did not select a banker.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Analytics:</strong> Administrators have access to
                analytics that highlight referrals requiring attention.
            </li>
        </ul>
