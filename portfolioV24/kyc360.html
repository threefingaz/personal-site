        <h2>Role</h2>
        <p>
            My role was to analyze complex business processes and devise
            comprehensive solutions. My responsibilities ranged from
            understanding the basic requirements—such as initiating or
            terminating corporate client relationships—to managing detailed KYC
            reviews requiring coordination both internally and with client
            representatives.
        </p>

            <li>
                <strong>External Interface:</strong> Developed for corporate
                clients, enhancing their engagement through a user-friendly

            Simplified user interface that hides underlying complexities, with
            distinct pipelines for different processes ensuring continuous

        </p>
        <h3>User Roles:</h3>

        </p>
        <h4>Client Page:</h4>

            provides a comprehensive overview of ongoing processes and
            highlights areas requiring attention.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Standardization:</strong> Addressed the need for
                standardized processes across global locations to reduce KYC
                risks and associated fines.
                <strong>Transparency and Automation:</strong> Integrated a
                single source of truth for KYC data, improving transparency and
                reducing manual interventions through structured communications.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Team Collaboration</h2>
        <p>
            Conducted regular catch-ups with business users to refine
            requirements and develop the solution.<br />
            Employed Figma prototypes for external user testing to gather
            feedback and ensure the solution's effectiveness from the outset.
        </p>
        <p>
            Worked alongside two development teams: a local team of 10 members
            and a remote team. For the client-accessible part, I worked together
            with the product owner and design department of the client
            experience team.
